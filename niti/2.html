  <p>Where did the handsome beloved go?
I wonder, where did that tall, shapely cypress tree go?
 
</p>
<p>He spread his light among us like a candle.
Where did he go? So strange, where did he go without me? </p> 
<p>
All day long my heart trembles like a leaf.
All alone at midnight, where did that beloved go? </p> <p>Go to the road, and ask any passing traveler — 
That soul-stirring companion, where did he go?</p> <p>  Go to the garden, and ask the gardener — 
That tall, shapely rose stem, where did he go?</p><p>  Go to the rooftop, and ask the watchman — 
That unique sultan, where did he go?</p> <p>  Like a madman, I search in the meadows!
That deer in the meadows, where did he go?</p><p>  My tearful eyes overflow like a river — 
That pearl in the vast sea, where did he go?</p>  <div>
<p> All night long, I implore both moon and Venus — 
That lovely face, like a moon, where did he go?</p> 
<p>If he is mine, why is he with others?
Since he’s not here, to what “there” did he go?  </p>
<p> If his heart and soul are joined with God,
And he left this realm of earth and water, where did he go?</p> 

<p> Tell me clearly, Shams of Tabriz,
Of whom it is said, “The sun never dies” — where did he go?</p>
